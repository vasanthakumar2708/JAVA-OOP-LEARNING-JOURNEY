# Java OOP Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) learning journey!  
I am currently learning Java OOP concepts using **IntelliJ IDEA** and documenting my progress here.  

## 📚 What I'm Learning
This repository covers the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Java, including:  
- ✅ Classes and Objects
- ✅ DataHiding 
- ✅ Inheritance  
- ✅ Polymorphism  
- ✅ Encapsulation  
- ✅ Abstraction
- ✅ Is A Relationship
- ✅ Has A Relationship
- ✅ Method Signature
- ✅ Method Overloading
- ✅ Method Overriding
- ✅ Method Hiding
- ✅ Static control overflow
- ✅ Instance control overflow
- ✅ Constructors
- ✅ Type casting
- ✅ Coupling 

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to a specific OOP concept with Java code examples and explanations:  
- **01-Classes-and-Objects:** Basic introduction to classes and object creation.  
- **02-Inheritance:** Understanding inheritance with examples.  
- **03-Polymorphism:** Exploring method overloading and overriding.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in OOP using Java.  
- Share my progress and code examples.  
- Encourage collaboration and feedback.  

## 📖 Learning Log
I am also maintaining a [LEARNING_LOG.md](LEARNING_LOG.md) file where I track my daily progress and concepts learned.  

## 📬 Feedback & Collaboration
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you'd like to collaborate or suggest improvements!
