/*
Question: Create a Bank Account Management System
Write a program to simulate a bank account using encapsulation. The program should include the following:

Class: BankAccount

Private attributes:
accountNumber (String)
accountHolderName (String)
balance (double)
Public methods:
Getters for all attributes.
Setters for accountHolderName (allowing updates to the name but not account number or balance directly).
deposit(double amount):
Add the specified amount to the balance if itâ€™s positive.
Display an error if the amount is negative or zero.
withdraw(double amount):
Deduct the specified amount from the balance if there are sufficient funds.
Display an error if the amount exceeds the balance or is negative.
displayAccountDetails():
Print all account details (except sensitive information like account number).
Main Class: BankSystem

Create an object of BankAccount.
Initialize it with values for accountNumber, accountHolderName, and balance.
Use setter and getter methods to update the account holder's name.
Perform deposit and withdrawal operations and handle errors gracefully.

/*
Here by using Encapsulation, i created a class Bankaccount in that class i created methods related to the
bankaccount after that in the main function i called the respective functions.

In bankaccount class i only used get set method for accountholdername because we can't change the accountnumber
or balance, but we can change the accountholder name so that's why I didn't use get set method for accountnumber and
balance.
